#YOLO Detection for Plastic Recycling with Fungi

This project is part of a system for plastic recycling using fungi. It utilizes a YOLO model trained on a custom dataset, supplemented with some stock images.

##Current Capabilities

At the moment, the model recognizes 11 objects:

-Bottle
-Bag
-Bottle cap
-Plastic lid from cups
-Dishwashing sponge
-Blister packs from tablets
-Food packaging
-Cigarette butts
-Gum packaging
-Plastic cup
-Cotton swabs

###Future Plans

The project is continuously improving:
-New object classes are being added
-The accuracy of the neural network is being enhanced

Stay tuned for updates!
